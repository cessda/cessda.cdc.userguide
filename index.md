This is the User Guide for version 3.7.0 of the CESSDA Data Catalogue.

The CESSDA Data Catalogue contains descriptions (metadata) of the more than 40,000 data collections
held by CESSDAâ€™s Service Providers (SPs).
It is a one-stop shop for searching and finding European social science datasets from over
20 European countries. The presented data includes a range of data types,
such as quantitative, qualitative or mixed-modes data, covering both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies, as well as recently collected and historical data.
The metadata (study descriptions) are presented in the language as originally
provided by the organisations producing the metadata. Some publishers provide
study descriptions both in English and in the local language, some only in either
English or in the local language. Currently, about 75% of study descriptions
are available in English.
