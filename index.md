# CESSDA Data Catalogue User Guide

This is the user guide for version 3.2.0 of the [CESSDA Data Catalogue](https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/).

It contains descriptions of the more than 40,000 data collections held by CESSDA's Service Providers (SPs).
Datasets come from over 20 European countries. It is a one-stop shop for searching and finding European social science data.
The data described may be quantitative, qualitative or mixed-modes data, cross-sectional or longitudinal,
recently collected or historical data.
The metadata (study descriptions) are in whatever language they were provided by the organisations producing the metadata.
Some publishers provide study descriptions both in English and in the local language,
some only in either English or in the local language.
Currently, about 75% of study descriptions are available in English.
