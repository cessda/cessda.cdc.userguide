Clicking on the name of the data collection (highlighted in blue) provides more detailed information,
such as Methodology, Access information, Topics, and Keywords and the persistent identifier to be used when citing the data.

The “Clear search” button clears only the text in the search box.
It does not clear any existing filters applied in the left column, see :doc:`Filtered Search <filtered-search>`.
