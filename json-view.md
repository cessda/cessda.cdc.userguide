You can view the study description in JSON format, by clicking on 'View JSON'.
 The appearance of the JSON content may vary based on the browser you are using.
Currently only Firefox displays JSON in structured format by default.
For other browsers, you need to install a JSON formatter extension to avoid seeing unformatted JSON.

This is the JSON view in Safari, without a JSON formatting extension.
