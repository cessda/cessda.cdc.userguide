Clicking on the study title (highlighted in blue) in the results list produces more detailed information,
such as creators of the data, abstract, methodology, topics, keywords,
the persistent identifier to be used when citing the data.
There is also a link to the study on the Publisher website for information on access to actual data files.
If the Publisher website shows that the data are available with one of the CC-BY licenses,
there is more information on those licenses at [About CC Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/).

Many organisations providing metadata for the catalogue use the
same controlled vocabularies to describe the methodology used for the studies.
The infotips (highlighted here with a red circle) contain the names and links to these vocabularies.

You can see topics and keywords by clicking these sections open.
If you see a topic or keyword relevant to you (e.g. “Drinking behaviour”), click on it.
The system will carry out a search based on the term clicked.
