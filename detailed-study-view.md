Clicking on a study title (highlighted in blue) within the results list will take you to the detailed study view,
with more detailed information about the study.
This information includes creators of the data, abstract, methodology, topics and keywords,
and the persistent identifier to be used when citing the data.
Additionally, you will find a link to the study on the Publisher’s website where information on access to
the actual data files can be found.
If the Publisher’s website shows that the data are available with one of the CC-BY licences,
further information on those licences can be found at
[About CC Licences](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/).

Many organisations providing metadata to the data catalogue use the
same controlled vocabularies to describe the methodology used for the studies.
The infotips (highlighted here with a red circle in the image below)
contain the names and links to these vocabularies.

Below the abstract section, you will find topics and keywords.
If you see a topic or keyword relevant to you (e.g. “Drinking behaviour”), you can click on it.
This will initiate a search using this topic or keyword in the topic or keyword filters.

The ‘Access data’ button, found on top of the detailed study view page, brings you to the study description page on
the metadata publisher’s website.
Here you will find information on access to the data files.
This is also a way to find the different national publisher’s catalogues which may provide more search opportunities,
including variable-level searches.

You can also view the study description in JSON format.
See the [View JSON]({% link json-view.md %}) section for details.
