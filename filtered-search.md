The system allows filtering by topic, date of data collection, country in which the study place,
and the institution providing the study metadata.
These institutions are mainly research data archives.
Note the limitations: the country and date filters include only those studies
where the metadata provided the date and country information in standardised, machine-actionable format.

Using filters increases the precision of your search.
Try, for example, entering into the search box: *travel norway*. You get a lot of results.
If you enter into the search box the word *travel* and choose Norway from the country filter,
you get fewer but more relevant results.
If you are interested only in data collected over, for instance, the last five years,
use the date of collection filter.

If you use more than one filter, the default between them is AND, so both have to apply in the results.

To keep the filters selected active,
use the ‘Back’ button or the arrow on top left to navigate back to the search page.
If you click on the data catalogue logo instead, all selections will disappear.

Use ‘Reset filters’ button to clear your filter selections.
