The system allows filtering by topic, data collection year,
country in which the study took place, and the institution providing the study metadata.
These institutions are mainly research Data Archives.
Note the limitations: the country and collection years filters include
only those studies where the metadata includes the country
and data information in standardised, machine-actionable format.

Using filters increases the precision of the search.
Try, for example, entering into the search box: *travel norway*.
There are a lot of results. If you enter the word *travel* into the search box
and choose Norway from the country filter, you get fewer but more relevant results.
If you are interested only in data collected over, for instance, the last five years,
use the collection years filter.

If you wish to find historical data, use the collection years filter.
For example, for data on political issues in the post-war period,
first select *1945-1955* as collection years and enter
e.g. *election political politics* in the search box.
Another good option is to browse the **Topic** filter after you have first selected the collection years.
There you can choose topics like Elections, Political attitudes and behaviour, Politics,
International politics and organisation, whatever is relevant for you.

If you use more than one filter, the default between them is AND, so both have to apply in the results.

To keep the filters selected active,
use the ‘Back’ button or the arrow on top left to navigate back to the search page.
If you click on the data catalogue logo instead, all selections will disappear.

Use the ‘Reset filters’ button to clear your filter selections.
