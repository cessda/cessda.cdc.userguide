# Basic Search

Basic keyword search is provided in the search bar in the upper right.
The number of results is presented in the upper left, and can be sorted by relevance, title, and date of the collection.

The interface language options are provided in the far upper right with a drop down list.

A simple search on the keyword “environment” in English returns 2578 results
(At the time of writing, the actual number of results may change -- shown in upper left).

Clicking on the name of the data collection (highlighted in blue) provides more detailed information,
such as Methodology, Access information, Topics, and Keywords and the persistent identifier to be used when citing the data.

The “Clear search” button clears only the text in the search box.
It does not clear any existing filters applied in the left column, see [Filtered Search]({% link filtered-search.md %}).
